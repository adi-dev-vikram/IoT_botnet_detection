# IoT_botnet_detection

## About the project :

There has been a significant rise in IoT devices and since these devices are less secure and are vulnerable to DDoS attacks and often targeted by botnets. It could be advantageous to develop a machine learning model that predicts ddos attacks. Internet of Things (IoT) devices are widely used in modern homes and every part of our lives, because they are not that sophisticated, it becomes an easy target for Denial of service attack.
