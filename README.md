# IoT_botnet_detection

## About the project :

There has been a significant rise in IoT devices and since these devices are less secure and are vulnerable to DDoS attacks and often targeted by botnets. It could be advantageous to develop a machine learning model that predicts ddos attacks. Internet of Things (IoT) devices are widely used in modern homes and every part of our lives, because they are not that sophisticated, it becomes an easy target for Denial of service attack.

## About the dataset :

The BoT-IoT dataset was created by cybersecurity lab in UNSW Canberra. The network environment incorporated a combination of benign and botnet or malicious traffic. I have combined the datasets into a single csv file. The files were separated, based on attack category and subcategory, to better assist in labeling process.
